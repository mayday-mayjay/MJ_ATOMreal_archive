this is an archive of u/ATOM_real / u/The_Foothills' massive spritepack drive! as well as recreating lost ones after atom was (rightfully) booted from the MAS community, now with no bad submod code attached! this also *modernizes* the spritepacks' jsons to have more unique gift/id/thumb names to avoid clashing with other spritepacks, as well as updates certain packs to work with submodded selectors that have been released since atom's booting

### ‚õî !! note: this has *all* of their rpys scrubbed from the packs until further notices, including gift reactions, outfit modes, locations, ect. if you want atom's original selectors (table and mask) they're not in this repo, they're being [maintained by u/mayday-mayjay here](https://github.com/mayday-mayjay/MJ-MAS-selector-city)

this archive is very  incomplete due to atom's mega/gdrive being deleted along with their original reddit account, and we'd love your help to complete it! keep reading to find out how you can help! 

## üì° ‚≠ë how to help finish the archive

here's 4 ways you can help us finish this archive, all of which involve making and issue on this repo!

[click here if you would like to know how to make an issue for us!](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue)

1. if you have your own (at least mainly) untouched download of atom's mega drive we'd be incredibly grateful if you sent it our way! we can pick thru and see if there's anything we missed/can modernize, and you'll be credited heavily for helping us!

2. send original versions of spritepacks by atom_real in a .zip, .7zip, .rar file or gdrive share link (youll be credited!). the main part we need are the images that'll actually show up on monika when she's wearing it, so don't be afraid to just only give those parts if you cant find the rest (though obviously the more you can send, the better)

3. pointing out which ones are still missing from this archive, this way we can either be on the look out for it or remake it ourselves for people to have, please try to send daytime screenshots of the pack youre trying to point out so we have a better idea what youre asking for

4. linking us to a spritepack that recreates one of atom's work, we won't put it directly in the archive since so we don't unrightfully repost someone else's work (unless we're given permission ofc) but! we will link it in a section of this page for you to use/find!


## ‚ùî ‚≠ë how to spot atom's work

atom's main thing was that they made a lot of recolor sets for various spritepacks in the fandom, they were also very meticulous with putting their name in jsons, but if you dont have the jsons and just the art, theses colors tended to end up in a recolor pack;

* bright pink 
* matrix (dark dusty pink)
* (bright red) ruby
* burgundy
* coral brown / regular brown
* (high contrast) gold
* "py" yellow
* conifer
* emerald green / lunar green / sea green
* pelorous / "gimp tint"
* aquamarine
* (bright blue) sapphire
* ghost blue + transparent ghost edits 
* black / gray / white
