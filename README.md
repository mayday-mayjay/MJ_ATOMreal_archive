this is an archive of u/ATOM_real / u/The_Foothills' massive recolor pack as well as recreating lost ones after atom was (rightfully) booted from the MAS community, now with no bad submod code attached! this also *modernizes* their work to have more unique gift/id/thumb names to avoid clashing with other spritepacks, as well as updates certain packs to work with submodded selectors that have been released since atom's booting

### ‚õî !! note: this has *all* of their rpys scrubbed from the packs until further notices, including gift reactions, outfit modes, locations, ect. if you want atom's original selectors (table and mask) they're not in this repo, they're being [maintained by u/mayday-mayjay here](https://github.com/mayday-mayjay/MJ-MAS-selector-city)

this archive is very much incomplete due to atom's mega/gdrive being deleted along with their original reddit account, and we'd love your help to complete it! keep reading to find out how you can help! 

## üì° ‚≠ë how to help finish the archive

here's 4 ways you can help us finish this archive

1. obviously, if you have your own (at least mainly) untouched download of atom's mega drive before it was deleted, we'd be incredibly grateful if you sent it our way by opening an issue for us to pick thru and see if there's anything we missed/can modernize, you'll be credited heavily for helping us!

2. the main/preferred way to to help with this archive will be to open an issue on this repo and send original versions of spritepacks by atom_real in a .zip, .7zip, .rar file or gdrive share link (youll be credited!)

the main part we need are the images that'll actually show up on monika when she's wearing it, so don't be afraid to just only give those parts if you cant find the rest (thought obviously the more you can send, the better)

3. pointing out which ones are still missing from this archive by opening an issue and telling us, this way we can either be on the look out for it or remake it ourselves for people to have, please try to send screenshots of the pack you are trying to point out so we have a better idea what youre asking for

4. opening an issue and linking us to a spritepack that recreates one of atom's work, we won't put it directly in the archive since its not an atom original so we don't unrightfully repost someone else's work (unless we are given permission ofc) but! we will link it in a section of this page for you to use/find!
